Absolutely! Let’s create a **set of Java File I/O + Serialization interview questions**. I’ll organize them from **basic → intermediate → tricky**, so you can gradually challenge yourself.

---

# **1️⃣ Basic Questions**

1. Explain the difference between **InputStream / OutputStream** and **Reader / Writer**.
2. How does **FileReader** differ from **BufferedReader**? Why use BufferedReader?
3. What is **try-with-resources**? How is it different from a normal try-catch-finally block?
4. Explain **serialization** and **deserialization**. Why is it useful?
5. What does the **transient** keyword do in Java?
6. Can we serialize a class that does not implement `Serializable`? What happens?
7. What are the differences between **FileWriter** and **FileOutputStream**?

---

# **2️⃣ Coding / Practical Questions (Basic)**

1. Write a Java program to **read a text file line by line** and print it to the console.
2. Write a Java program to **copy one file to another** using **byte streams**.
3. Write a Java program to **append text** to an existing file using **BufferedWriter**.
4. Write a program to **count the number of lines** in a text file.

# **3️⃣ Serialization / Object I/O Questions (Intermediate)**

1. Create a `Student` class with fields `id`, `name`, and `password`. Serialize it to a file, then deserialize it. Make sure **password is not serialized**.
2. Explain **what happens if a field in a serialized object is `static`?**
3. Write a Java program to **serialize a list of objects** (e.g., `ArrayList<Student>`) to a file and read it back.
4. Write a program to **serialize an object to a byte array** instead of a file (use `ByteArrayOutputStream`) and deserialize it.
5. What happens if the class structure changes after serialization (e.g., a new field is added)? How can you handle it? (`serialVersionUID`)

---

# **4️⃣ Java NIO / Modern I/O Questions**

1. Write a Java program to **read all lines of a file** using `Files.readAllLines()` and print them.
2. Write a program to **write a string to a file** using `Files.write()`.
3. Explain the difference between **java.io.File** and **java.nio.file.Path**.
4. How would you **check if a file exists** using NIO?
5. What is a **Channel** in NIO? Write a simple example of copying a file using `FileChannel`.

---

# **5️⃣ Tricky / Scenario-Based Questions**

1. You have a `HashMap<String, Student>` that you want to save to disk. How would you serialize it?
2. Can you **serialize a singleton class** safely? How?
3. How would you **serialize an object** and send it **over a network socket**?
4. Explain the difference between **shallow copy** and **deep copy** in the context of serialization.
5. How can you **store a serialized object on a USB/pendrive** and read it back in Java?

---

# **6️⃣ Tips for Solving These in Interviews**

* Always **close streams** — preferably use **try-with-resources**.
* Remember: `transient` fields **won’t be saved**.
* For object versioning, **define `serialVersionUID`**.
* Practice **both byte streams and character streams**.
* For NIO, focus on **Files.readString, Files.write, Paths.get** for simple problems.

If you want, I can **make a ready-to-practice question set with 20–25 exercises**, including **“write code” + “explain output” + “scenario-based”**, specifically designed for **Java File I/O & Serialization interviews**, so you can start solving them one by one.

Do you want me to make that next?
