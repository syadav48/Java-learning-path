1. Don't try to solve every test case
2. Start with very basic one, if it has only 3 inputs, then dont compare with 10 inputs
3. Keep in mind for 3 inputs, what would be S(n) or S(3), try to solve first S(0), S(1), S(2), S(3)...S(N).
4. Dont cross the test cases of every problems. Hold one and solve that only and implement S(0), S(1), S(2)...for that only
5. For the other, automatic that problem implement, but dont mix or cross the implementation.
