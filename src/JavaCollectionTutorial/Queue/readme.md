Perfect ‚Äî this is one of the **most conceptually rich topics** in Java Collections.
Here‚Äôs your **complete + crisp cheat sheet on Java Queue Implementations**, with **overview, use-cases, internal structures, concurrency behavior, and time complexities.**

# üß± **QUEUE IN JAVA ‚Äî OVERVIEW**

### ‚úÖ Definition:

A **Queue** is a **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** data structure that:

* Inserts elements at **rear (tail)**.
* Removes elements from **front (head)**.
* Used for **buffering, scheduling, and producer-consumer** scenarios.

`Queue` is an interface under `java.util`, extended by `Deque` and several concurrent variants.

## üß† **Key Queue Methods**

| Method                    | Description                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `add(E e)` / `offer(E e)` | Insert element (offer returns false instead of throwing exception) |
| `remove()` / `poll()`     | Remove head (poll returns null if empty)                           |
| `element()` / `peek()`    | View head without removing                                         |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **TIME COMPLEXITIES**

| Implementation        | Insert         | Remove   | Peek |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------- | ---- |
| LinkedList            | O(1)           | O(1)     | O(1) |
| ArrayDeque            | O(1) amortized | O(1)     | O(1) |
| PriorityQueue         | O(log n)       | O(log n) | O(1) |
| ConcurrentLinkedQueue | O(1)           | O(1)     | O(1) |
| Blocking Queues       | O(1)           | O(1)     | O(1) |
| DelayQueue            | O(log n)       | O(log n) | O(1) |

# ü™£ **IMPLEMENTATIONS OF QUEUE**

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **LinkedList (Queue Interface Implementation)**

* Doubly linked list.
* Implements `Queue`, `Deque`, `List`.
* Maintains **insertion order**.
* Allows **null**.

```java
Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
q.offer(10);
q.offer(20);
System.out.println(q.poll()); // 10
```

üß© **Use When:** You want a **simple FIFO queue** with **frequent insert/remove** operations.

‚ö†Ô∏è Not thread-safe.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **PriorityQueue**

* Based on **Binary Heap (min-heap)**.
* Elements ordered **by natural ordering or Comparator**.
* **Not FIFO**, instead **priority-based**.
* No nulls allowed.

```java
Queue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
pq.add(30);
pq.add(10);
pq.add(20);
System.out.println(pq.poll()); // 10 (lowest first)
```

üß© **Use When:** You want to process elements **by priority** instead of arrival order (like task scheduling).

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**

* Interface extending Queue.
* Supports **insertion/removal from both ends**.
* Basis for **stack**, **queue**, and **sliding window** implementations.

---

### üîπ **ArrayDeque**

* Backed by **resizable circular array**.
* Faster than LinkedList (no node overhead).
* No nulls.

```java
Deque<Integer> dq = new ArrayDeque<>();
dq.addFirst(1);
dq.addLast(2);
System.out.println(dq.removeFirst());
```

üß© **Use When:** You need both **stack + queue behavior** (LIFO/FIFO).

‚ö° **Most efficient non-thread-safe general-purpose queue**.

---

### üîπ **LinkedList (as Deque)**

* Can also be used as `Deque`.
* Supports all `Deque` operations.
* Slightly slower than ArrayDeque due to node allocation.

üß© **Use When:** You need a linked structure (frequent removals from middle, not just ends).

---

### üîπ **ConcurrentLinkedDeque**

* Thread-safe, non-blocking, **lock-free** deque.
* Uses **CAS (Compare-And-Swap)** operations.
* High concurrency for **multiple producers/consumers**.

üß© **Use When:** You need a **concurrent deque** (e.g., work-stealing algorithms).

---

## üí° **Why Deque Is So Important**

Because it can act as:

* **Queue (FIFO):** `offerLast()`, `pollFirst()`
* **Stack (LIFO):** `push()`, `pop()`
* Used in algorithms like **Sliding Window**, **Undo Stack**, **BFS**, **Deque-based Scheduling**.

---

# üöß **BLOCKING QUEUES (java.util.concurrent)**

These are **thread-safe queues** that **block** on operations when full (for producer) or empty (for consumer).
Used in **Producer-Consumer, ThreadPool, Message Queues**.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **ArrayBlockingQueue**

* Fixed-size array-backed blocking queue.
* FIFO order.
* Throws exception or blocks if full.

```java
BlockingQueue<Integer> bq = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(3);
```

üß© **Use When:** You want a **bounded blocking queue** (control queue capacity).

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **LinkedBlockingQueue**

* Optionally bounded (default: `Integer.MAX_VALUE`).
* Linked list structure.
* **Higher throughput** than ArrayBlockingQueue.

üß© **Use When:** You want a **high-performance, thread-safe queue** for producer-consumer tasks.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **PriorityBlockingQueue**

* Thread-safe version of `PriorityQueue`.
* Unbounded.
* Orders elements by **priority**.

üß© **Use When:** You need **concurrent priority processing**, e.g., job schedulers.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **SynchronousQueue**

* No capacity at all (size = 0).
* Each insert waits for a corresponding remove (handoff mechanism).

```java
BlockingQueue<Integer> sq = new SynchronousQueue<>();
```

üß© **Use When:** You need **direct handoff** between producer & consumer (e.g., thread pools).

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **DelayQueue**

* Unbounded blocking queue of elements implementing `Delayed`.
* Elements become available **only after delay expires**.

```java
DelayQueue<DelayedTask> dq = new DelayQueue<>();
```

üß© **Use When:** You need **time-based scheduling**, e.g., cache expiration, delayed tasks.

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è **CONCURRENT QUEUES**

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **ConcurrentLinkedQueue**

* **Lock-free**, **thread-safe**, **non-blocking** queue.
* Uses **CAS operations** internally.
* Unbounded.

```java
Queue<Integer> cq = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
```

üß© **Use When:** You want **non-blocking concurrent access** without waiting (high concurrency, low latency).

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **ConcurrentLinkedDeque**

* Same as above, but **double-ended**.
* Used for **work-stealing** algorithms (threads pull from both ends).

üß© **Use When:** Need **lock-free, concurrent double-ended** access.

---

# üß© **WHY SO MANY QUEUES EXIST**

Each queue is designed for a **specific trade-off**:
