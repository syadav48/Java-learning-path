Excellent ‚Äî this takes you deep into **Java‚Äôs concurrency framework** (`java.util.concurrent.locks`), which is the **next level beyond `synchronized`**. Let‚Äôs go step-by-step conceptually and practically üëá

---

# üß† 1. Why `Lock` Interface When We Already Have `synchronized`?

While `synchronized` is **easy to use**, it has limitations:

* You **can‚Äôt try** to acquire a lock (you must wait).
* You **can‚Äôt interrupt** a thread waiting for a lock.
* You **can‚Äôt set fairness policies**.
* It‚Äôs **block structured** ‚Äî you can‚Äôt lock in one method and unlock in another.

To overcome this, Java introduced the **`Lock` interface** in `java.util.concurrent.locks` (Java 5+).
It gives **explicit locking** ‚Äî more control, more flexibility.

---

# üîí 2. The `Lock` Interface

```java
public interface Lock {
    void lock();
    void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException;
    boolean tryLock();
    boolean tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit) throws InterruptedException;
    void unlock();
    Condition newCondition();
}
```

---

# üß± 3. `ReentrantLock` ‚Äî The Most Common Lock

`ReentrantLock` is the **most used implementation** of `Lock`.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class SharedResource {
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private int counter = 0;

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock(); // acquire lock
        try {
            counter++;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " -> " + counter);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock(); // must release lock
        }
    }
}
```

---

# üîÅ 4. Why Is It Called **ReentrantLock**?

Because it is **reentrant** ‚Äî
if a thread already holds the lock, it can **acquire it again** **without blocking** itself.

Example:

```java
lock.lock();
lock.lock(); // same thread ‚Äî allowed!
try {
    // do something
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
    lock.unlock();
}
```

So a thread can reenter the same lock-protected block multiple times as long as it **releases** the lock the same number of times.

# ‚öôÔ∏è 5. Important Lock Methods

| Method                   | Description                                              | Example                             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `lock()`                 | Acquires the lock, waits if not available.               | `lock.lock();`                      |
| `unlock()`               | Releases the lock. Always in `finally`.                  | `lock.unlock();`                    |
| `tryLock()`              | Tries to acquire lock, returns `true/false` immediately. | `if (lock.tryLock()) {...}`         |
| `tryLock(timeout, unit)` | Waits for some time to acquire the lock.                 | `lock.tryLock(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)` |
| `lockInterruptibly()`    | Allows thread to be interrupted while waiting.           | `lock.lockInterruptibly();`         |

---

# ‚ö° 6. `lockInterruptibly()` Example

This method lets a **waiting thread** be **interrupted** while trying to acquire the lock.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class Demo {
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    void doTask() {
        try {
            lock.lockInterruptibly();
            try {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " working...");
                Thread.sleep(5000);
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " interrupted while waiting!");
        }
    }
}
```

If another thread calls `t.interrupt()`, the waiting thread exits immediately.

---

# ‚öñÔ∏è 7. Fairness Policy

When creating a `ReentrantLock`, you can choose **fair** or **non-fair** mode.

```java
Lock fairLock = new ReentrantLock(true);  // fair mode
Lock nonFairLock = new ReentrantLock();   // default: non-fair
```

* **Fair lock:** Threads acquire the lock **in order (FIFO)**.
* **Non-fair lock:** Threads can **‚Äújump ahead‚Äù**, increasing throughput but possibly causing **starvation**.

---

# üåü 8. Starvation

**Starvation** occurs when one or more threads **never get CPU or lock access** because others keep taking it.

Occurs typically in:

* Non-fair locks (default)
* Threads with lower priority

‚úÖ Use `new ReentrantLock(true)` to ensure fairness and prevent starvation.

---

# ‚ò†Ô∏è 9. Deadlock

A **deadlock** happens when two or more threads are **waiting for each other‚Äôs lock**, and none can proceed.

### Example:

```java
class A {
    void methodA(B b) {
        synchronized (this) {
            System.out.println("Thread 1: Locked A");
            try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (Exception e) {}
            synchronized (b) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Locked B");
            }
        }
    }
}

class B {
    void methodB(A a) {
        synchronized (this) {
            System.out.println("Thread 2: Locked B");
            try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (Exception e) {}
            synchronized (a) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Locked A");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Thread-1 locks A, waits for B.
Thread-2 locks B, waits for A.
‚Üí Both wait forever = **Deadlock**.

---

# üß© 10. Four Conditions for Deadlock

1. **Mutual Exclusion** ‚Äì Only one thread can access a resource at a time.
2. **Hold and Wait** ‚Äì Thread holds one resource, waits for another.
3. **No Preemption** ‚Äì Resource cannot be forcibly taken away.
4. **Circular Wait** ‚Äì Circular dependency (Thread1 ‚Üí A ‚Üí B ‚Üí Thread2 ‚Üí A...).

All 4 together ‚Üí Deadlock occurs.

| Strategy                                             | Description                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Avoid Circular Wait**                              | Acquire locks in **fixed global order** |
| **Use tryLock()**                                    | Avoid waiting forever                   |
| **Lock Timeout**                                     | Break out after waiting                 |
| **Deadlock Detection Tools**                         | Thread dumps (e.g., `jstack`)           |
| **Use High-Level Concurrency (Executor, Semaphore)** | Less manual locking                     |

Example:

```java
if (lock1.tryLock() && lock2.tryLock()) {
    try {
        // work safely
    } finally {
        lock1.unlock();
        lock2.unlock();
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("Could not acquire both locks, avoiding deadlock");
}
```

# üìö 12. ReadWriteLock

`ReadWriteLock` allows **multiple readers** but **only one writer**.

### Why?

Most data structures are read more often than written ‚Äî allowing concurrent reads improves performance.

### Implementation: `ReentrantReadWriteLock`

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.*;

class SharedData {
    private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private final Lock readLock = rwLock.readLock();
    private final Lock writeLock = rwLock.writeLock();
    private int data = 0;

    void read() {
        readLock.lock();
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " reads: " + data);
        } finally {
            readLock.unlock();
        }
    }

    void write(int value) {
        writeLock.lock();
        try {
            data = value;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " writes: " + data);
        } finally {
            writeLock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

üß© Multiple threads can call `read()` concurrently,
but `write()` is **exclusive**.

Would you like me to create a **visual diagram (PDF)** showing:

* Deadlock scenario (Thread A ‚Üî Thread B)
* Read vs Write locks (shared vs exclusive)
* Fair vs Non-fair scheduling timeline
  It‚Äôll make these relationships crystal clear.
