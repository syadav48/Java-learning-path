Perfect ‚Äî this is one of the **core topics** in Java concurrency and often asked in interviews.
Let‚Äôs go step-by-step from **conceptual ‚Üí Java-level ‚Üí example**.

## üß† 1. What is Synchronization?

**Synchronization** in Java is the process of **controlling access** to shared resources (like variables, objects, files, etc.) by **multiple threads**.

It ensures that only **one thread** can access a **critical section** of code at a time.

Without synchronization, two threads may **interfere** with each other‚Äôs operations, causing **inconsistent or unexpected results**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. What is a Critical Section?

A **critical section** is a block of code that **accesses shared data** (e.g., global variable, object field, etc.) and must **not be executed by more than one thread at a time**.

In Java, you can protect a critical section using the **`synchronized`** keyword.

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Critical Section (synchronized)
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

Here, `increment()` is a **critical section** ‚Äî if two threads call it simultaneously, synchronization ensures only one thread executes it at a time.

---

## ‚ö° 3. What is a Race Condition?

A **race condition** occurs when:

* Two or more threads access shared data **without synchronization**.
* The final output depends on the **timing** of thread execution.

### Example (Without Synchronization)

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class RaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) counter.increment();
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) counter.increment();
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final Count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

üéØ **Expected:** 2000
‚ö†Ô∏è **Actual (sometimes):** 1876, 1993, etc. (varies per run)

Because both threads may read the same value of `count` before either writes it back, leading to lost updates.

---

## üîí 4. What is Mutual Exclusion?

**Mutual exclusion (mutex)** means **only one thread** can execute a critical section at a time.

In Java, `synchronized` provides **mutual exclusion** by locking an object.

### Example (With Synchronization)

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

Now, `increment()` is synchronized:

* Thread-1 acquires the **object lock**.
* Thread-2 waits until Thread-1 releases it.

‚úÖ Output will always be **2000**.

---

## üß© 5. Object Lock vs Class Lock

* **Object lock:** Used for synchronized instance methods or blocks.
  Each object has its own lock.

* **Class lock:** Used for static synchronized methods.
  The lock is on the **`Class` object**, shared by all instances.

```java
synchronized (this) { ... }  // Object lock
synchronized (Counter.class) { ... }  // Class lock
```

---

## üîÅ 6. Synchronized Block (Fine-Grained Control)

Instead of synchronizing the entire method, you can synchronize **only the critical part**.

```java
public void increment() {
    synchronized (this) {
        count++;
    }
}
```

Better performance, as only small portion is locked.

---

## üßµ 7. notify(), notifyAll(), wait() (Thread Coordination)

These methods are used for **communication between threads**.

| Method        | Description                                                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wait()`      | Thread waits until another thread calls `notify()` or `notifyAll()` on the same object. |
| `notify()`    | Wakes up one thread waiting on that object‚Äôs monitor.                                   |
| `notifyAll()` | Wakes up all threads waiting on that object.                                            |

Example:

```java
class SharedResource {
    boolean available = false;

    synchronized void produce() {
        System.out.println("Producing...");
        available = true;
        notify();  // wake up waiting thread
    }

    synchronized void consume() {
        while (!available) {
            try {
                wait();  // wait for producer
            } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
        }
        System.out.println("Consumed!");
        available = false;
    }
}
```

| Concept              | Meaning                                  | Example                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Critical Section** | Code that accesses shared resources      | `count++`                 |
| **Race Condition**   | Threads interfere, data inconsistent     | Unsynchronized increment  |
| **Mutual Exclusion** | Only one thread allowed in section       | `synchronized`            |
| **Synchronization**  | Mechanism to enforce mutual exclusion    | Locking via monitor       |
| **Monitor Lock**     | Implicit lock acquired by `synchronized` | On `this` or class object |
| **wait/notify**      | Communication between threads            | Producer-Consumer         |

```
Shared Resource (count)
      |
   +--+-------------------------------+
   |                                  |
 Thread-1 (increment)           Thread-2 (increment)
   |                                  |

   |                                  |
 Writes count=1                 Writes count=1
   +----------------------------------+
   Final count = 1 ‚ùå (lost update)
```

‚úÖ Using `synchronized`, one thread completes before another starts, preserving correctness.

Would you like me to make a **diagrammatic PDF** summarizing
**Synchronization, Race Condition, Mutual Exclusion, and wait/notify cycle** with flow arrows (thread ‚Üí lock ‚Üí shared resource ‚Üí release)?
It‚Äôs very useful for interview prep and quick recall.
