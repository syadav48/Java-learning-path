Perfect — now that you understand **CountDownLatch**, you’re ready for its “sibling”: **CyclicBarrier** — another powerful synchronization tool in Java concurrency.

Let’s go step-by-step from **concept → real-life analogy → internals → methods → examples (including matrix multiplication)** → **use cases vs CountDownLatch**.

---

## 🧠 1. What is a `CyclicBarrier`?

A **CyclicBarrier** is a synchronization aid that allows a **group of threads** to **wait for each other** to reach a common execution point (called a *barrier*) **before continuing**.

* Unlike `CountDownLatch`, which is *one-way* (count only goes down once),
* `CyclicBarrier` is **cyclic** — it **resets automatically** after all threads reach the barrier, so it can be reused.

---

## 🧩 2. Real-life Analogy

Imagine a **relay race** 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️ —
All runners must gather at the starting line before the race can begin.
Each runner says “I’m ready!” and waits.
When everyone is ready, **the barrier opens**, and all start running together.

Next round? Same barrier, reused again!

---

## 🔹 3. Constructor

```java
CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(int parties);
```

or

```java
CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(int parties, Runnable barrierAction);
```

* **`parties`** → number of threads that must call `await()` before barrier opens.
* **`barrierAction`** → optional task executed once all threads reach the barrier.

## 🔹 4. Key Methods

| Method                               | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `await()`                            | Each thread calls this to wait at the barrier until all threads reach it.     |
| `await(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` | Waits for others up to a specific time, throws `TimeoutException` if delayed. |
| `getParties()`                       | Returns the number of threads required to trip the barrier.                   |
| `getNumberWaiting()`                 | Returns how many threads are currently waiting.                               |
| `isBroken()`                         | Returns `true` if the barrier is broken due to interruption or timeout.       |
| `reset()`                            | Resets the barrier to initial state (useful if one phase fails).              |

---

## 🔹 5. Example 1 — Basic CyclicBarrier

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class CyclicBarrierExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int totalThreads = 3;
        CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(totalThreads, 
            () -> System.out.println("All threads reached the barrier. Proceeding together..."));

        for (int i = 1; i <= totalThreads; i++) {
            final int threadId = i;
            new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    System.out.println("Thread " + threadId + " working...");
                    Thread.sleep(1000 * threadId);
                    System.out.println("Thread " + threadId + " waiting at barrier...");
                    barrier.await(); // wait for others
                    System.out.println("Thread " + threadId + " passed the barrier.");
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }).start();
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 🧾 Output

```
Thread 1 working...
Thread 2 working...
Thread 3 working...
Thread 1 waiting at barrier...
Thread 2 waiting at barrier...
Thread 3 waiting at barrier...
All threads reached the barrier. Proceeding together...
Thread 3 passed the barrier.
Thread 1 passed the barrier.
Thread 2 passed the barrier.
```

🧠 **Key takeaway:**
All threads stop at the barrier (like a checkpoint) and move together once all have arrived.

---

## 🔹 6. Why “Cyclic”?

Because after all threads cross the barrier, it **automatically resets**, allowing reuse.

**Example:**
You can run multiple **phases** (like multiple rounds in a game) — all threads meet at the barrier at the end of each phase.

---

## 🔹 7. Example 2 — Matrix Multiplication Using CyclicBarrier

Imagine we want to multiply two matrices in parallel — each thread multiplies one row, and when all rows are done, the barrier combines results.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class MatrixMultiplication {
    static final int SIZE = 3;
    static int[][] A = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} };
    static int[][] B = { {1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1} };
    static int[][] result = new int[SIZE][SIZE];

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(SIZE, () -> {
            System.out.println("All rows calculated. Final Result:");
            printMatrix(result);
        });

        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            int row = i;
            new Thread(() -> multiplyRow(row, barrier)).start();
        }
    }

    static void multiplyRow(int row, CyclicBarrier barrier) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " started calculating row " + row);
        for (int col = 0; col < SIZE; col++) {
            result[row][col] = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < SIZE; k++) {
                result[row][col] += A[row][k] * B[k][col];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished row " + row);
        try {
            barrier.await(); // wait for others to finish
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    static void printMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        for (int[] row : matrix) {
            for (int val : row) System.out.print(val + " ");
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 🧾 Output:

```
Thread-0 started calculating row 0
Thread-1 started calculating row 1
Thread-2 started calculating row 2
Thread-0 finished row 0
Thread-1 finished row 1
Thread-2 finished row 2
All rows calculated. Final Result:
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 
```

🧠 The **barrier** ensures that:

* Each thread finishes computing its row first.
* Only after *all* rows are done, the final print happens.

## 🔹 8. Use Cases

| Scenario                  | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parallel computations** | Split large tasks (matrix multiplication, sorting, etc.) among threads.         |
| **Simulation phases**     | Wait for all participants to reach the end of a phase before starting the next. |
| **Game synchronization**  | Wait for all players to finish one level before moving to the next.             |
| **Batch processing**      | Wait for multiple independent data fetchers to finish before aggregation.       |

## 🔹 9. CyclicBarrier vs CountDownLatch

| Feature         | **CyclicBarrier**        | **CountDownLatch**                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Reusable        | ✅ Yes (cyclic)           | ❌ No                                |
| Waiting threads | All wait for each other  | One or more threads wait for others |
| Typical use     | Synchronize phases       | Wait for completion                 |
| Reset method    | `reset()`                | ❌ Not supported                     |
| Example         | Parallel tasks in rounds | Wait for service initialization     |

---

## 🔹 10. Handling Exceptions & Broken Barriers

If a thread waiting at the barrier is **interrupted** or **times out**, the barrier becomes **broken**, and all other waiting threads get a `BrokenBarrierException`.

You can check:

```java
if (barrier.isBroken()) {
    System.out.println("Barrier is broken!");
}
```

You can **reset** the barrier for reuse:

```java
barrier.reset();
```

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |

Would you like me to continue next with **`Phaser`** — a more advanced, flexible synchronization mechanism that extends both `CountDownLatch` and `CyclicBarrier` concepts (supports dynamic registration & deregistration of parties)?
