Java is **always pass-by-value**. However, this can be confusing when working with objects.

- **For primitive types:** When you pass a primitive (like int, float, char, etc.), a **copy of the value** is passed to the method. This means that any changes made to the parameter inside the method do **not** affect the original variable outside the method.

    - **Example:**
      ```java
      void modify(int x) { x = 10; }
      int a = 5;
      modify(a); // 'a' is still 5 after this call
      ```
    - **Explanation:** Only the value (5) is copied; 'a' outside is unchanged.

- **For objects:** When you pass an object, you are still passing **by value**, but the value is the **reference** to the object, not the actual object itself. So, both the original and the parameter inside the method refer to the same object. This means:
    - If you modify the object's internal state (like changing a field), that change is visible outside the method.
    - If you assign a new object to the parameter, the original reference outside is not affected.

    - **Example (modifying object):**
      ```java
      void modifyObj(MyClass obj) { obj.value = 10; }
      MyClass c = new MyClass();
      c.value = 5;
      modifyObj(c); // c.value is now 10, change is visible
      ```

    - **Example (reassigning reference):**
      ```java
      void resetObj(MyClass obj) { obj = new MyClass(); obj.value = 0; }
      MyClass c = new MyClass();
      c.value = 5;
      resetObj(c); // c is still the original object with value 5
      ```
    - **Explanation:** The reference (the memory address) is copied – changes to the object contents persist, but reassigning the reference inside the method does not change the original reference outside.

**Summary:**  
Java always passes method arguments by value. For primitives, the value is the data itself. For objects, the value is the reference (memory address), not the actual object – so object contents can be changed inside the method, but the original reference variable cannot be changed to point to a new object.

**Key phrase:**
- "Java is always pass-by-value."
- "But for objects, the value that gets passed is the reference to the object, not the actual object."
- "You cannot change the original reference, but you can mutate the object."


Here are some simple and **real-world Java examples** to help you fully understand whether Java is pass-by-value or pass-by-reference:

***

**1. Primitive Type Example (Pass-by-Value)**
```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int price = 100;
        applyDiscount(price);
        System.out.println(price); // Output: 100 (unchanged)
    }

    public static void applyDiscount(int amount) {
        amount = amount - 20;
    }
}
```
- **Explanation:**  
  Passing `price` into `applyDiscount` creates a copy. Changes in the method do **not** affect the original value.

***

**2. Object Example – Changing Object’s State**
```java
class BankAccount {
    int balance = 1000;
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount acc = new BankAccount();
        addInterest(acc);
        System.out.println(acc.balance); // Output: 1050
    }
    public static void addInterest(BankAccount account) {
        account.balance += 50; // modifies the same object's state
    }
}
```
- **Explanation:**  
  Passing the reference allows the method to change the object’s fields. The change is visible outside.

***

**3. Object Example – Assigning a New Object (Reference Change)**
```java
class BankAccount {
    int balance = 1000;
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount acc = new BankAccount();
        openNewAccount(acc);
        System.out.println(acc.balance); // Output: 1000
    }
    public static void openNewAccount(BankAccount account) {
        account = new BankAccount();
        account.balance = 5000; // only changes local copy of reference
    }
}
```
- **Explanation:**  
  Assigning a new object to the parameter only changes the local reference inside the method. The original outside is **not** affected.

***

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **Primitive:** Giving someone a photocopy of a document. They can write on the copy, but your original stays the same.
- **Object Reference:** Giving someone your house keys (reference). They can rearrange the furniture (change object content), but if they make a copy of the key and give it away, your house (original object) doesn’t move.
