Excellent question üëç ‚Äî you‚Äôve covered a solid set already (**Strings, Collections, Streams, Functions/Collectors**), but Java is a vast language. If you want to move from **intermediate ‚Üí advanced**, here‚Äôs what you may still be missing (in order of importance):

---

## ‚úÖ Topics You Should Add Next

### **1. Generics (MUST before advanced Collections/Streams)**

* Why: They make Collections **type-safe**.
* Topics: generic classes, methods, bounded types (`<T extends Number>`), wildcards (`? super`, `? extends`).
* Example: `List<String>` vs `List<Object>`, writing your own generic `Box<T>` class.

---

### **2. Comparable & Comparator**

* Why: Sorting **custom objects** (like Student by marks, Employee by salary).
* `Comparable` (natural ordering, `compareTo`)
* `Comparator` (custom ordering, lambda-based sorting).

---

### **3. Exception Handling**

* Try‚Äìcatch‚Äìfinally, throw/throws, custom exceptions.
* Checked vs unchecked exceptions.
* Best practices (avoid swallowing exceptions).

---

### **4. Java I/O & NIO**

* File handling (`FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, `PrintWriter`).
* Serialization & Deserialization.
* NIO (`Paths`, `Files`, channels, buffers).
* Reading large files with `Streams`.

---

### **5. Multithreading & Concurrency**

* Threads (`Thread` class, `Runnable` interface).
* Synchronization (`synchronized`, locks).
* Executors (`ExecutorService`, `Future`, `Callable`).
* Modern concurrency (`CompletableFuture`, parallel streams).

---

### **6. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA in Java)**

* Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues, LinkedLists.
* Trees (BST, Heap), Graph basics.
* Searching (binary search), Sorting (merge sort, quick sort).
* Time complexity analysis (Big-O).

---

### **7. Java 8+ Advanced Features**

* Method references & constructor references.
* Optional (avoid `NullPointerException`).
* Default & static methods in interfaces.
* Streams advanced (`flatMap`, custom collectors).

---

### **8. Design Patterns (Object-Oriented Best Practices)**

* Singleton, Factory, Builder, Strategy, Observer.
* How to use them in Java projects.

---

### **9. JVM & Memory Management**

* Stack vs heap, garbage collection.
* Class loading process.
* Performance tuning basics.

---

### **10. Framework Readiness (Next Step)**

* If you aim for **backend work**: Spring Boot basics (REST APIs, dependency injection).
* If you aim for **competitive coding/interviews**: more DSA focus.

---

‚úÖ So, the **next major things missing** for you:

* **Generics, Comparator, Exception Handling, Multithreading, File I/O.**
* Once strong ‚Üí dive into **JVM internals, Design Patterns, Spring Boot**.

---

Would you like me to prepare a **follow-up 1-month roadmap** (after your current 1-week plan) that covers these **missing topics step by step**, moving from intermediate ‚Üí advanced Java?
