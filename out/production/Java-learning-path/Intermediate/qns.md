# ðŸ“Œ Java Intermediate Level Practice Roadmap (1 Week)

This roadmap contains **80 intermediate-level Java practice problems** across **Strings, Collections, Streams, and Functions/Collectors**. The plan is divided into **7 days** so you can practice consistently and steadily. Each problem is fully detailed.

18. Check if a string has all unique characters without using extra data structures.
19. Implement a method to find edit distance (Levenshtein distance) between two strings.
20. Implement word wrap: break a long string into multiple lines of max `k` characters.

6. Find the intersection of two `ArrayList<Integer>`.
7. Implement a `Queue` using two `Stacks`.

12. Implement a `PriorityQueue` for `Task` objects (taskName, priority).
13. Merge overlapping intervals stored in a `List<int[]>`.
14. Design a system to store student records and fetch top scorer efficiently.
15. Build a simple in-memory key-value database using `HashMap` (support insert, delete, search).
16. Implement a phone book using `Map<String, List<String>>` (name â†’ phone numbers).
17. Sort a `List<String>` by the frequency of characters.
18. Convert a `HashMap` into a list of entries sorted by values.
19. Use `Deque` to check if a string is a palindrome.
20. Implement a custom iterator for an array.

## ðŸ“… **Day 5â€“7: Mix & Solve (Review + Advanced Intermediate)**

Use the remaining days to:

* Revise all **80 problems**.
* Re-solve tricky ones without looking at answers.
* Mix problems from Strings, Collections, Streams, and Collectors.
* Try to implement **your own data structures** (Stack, Queue, LRU Cache).
* Work on mini-projects combining all concepts (e.g., word frequency analyzer, student grading system, leaderboard).
