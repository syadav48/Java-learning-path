Here’s a **concise but interview-ready** note on **Access Modifiers in Java** with a table showing how they work in **packages** and **subclasses**.

# **Access Modifiers in Java**

Access modifiers define **visibility/scope** of classes, methods, and variables.

---

## **Types of Access Modifiers**

### 1. **public**

* Accessible **from anywhere** in the application.
* Used for **APIs, library methods**, and code meant for external use.

### 2. **default** (No modifier – *Package-Private*)

* Accessible **only within the same package**.
* Useful when classes/methods are for **internal package use only**.

### 3. **private**

* Accessible **only within the same class**.
* Used for **encapsulation** to hide implementation details.

### 4. **protected**

* Accessible **within the same package** and also in **subclasses (even in different packages)**.
* Often used when designing for inheritance.

## **Access Modifier Scope Table**

| Modifier      | Same Class | Same Package (non-subclass) | Subclass (same package) | Subclass (different package) | Other packages |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| **public**    | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes                       | ✅ Yes                   | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes          |
| **protected** | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes                       | ✅ Yes                   | ✅ Yes                        | ❌ No           |
| **default**   | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes                       | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ No                         | ❌ No           |
| **private**   | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No                        | ❌ No                    | ❌ No                         | ❌ No           |

## **When to Use Which**

* **public:** For methods that are part of the API or must be accessible everywhere.
* **protected:** For methods/fields that should be inherited but not exposed to all.
* **default:** For internal package functionality.
* **private:** For internal class logic, sensitive data, and enforcing encapsulation.

✅ **Interview Points**

1. **Classes** can only be **public** or **default** (top-level).
2. **Methods & variables** can use all 4 modifiers.
3. **Default** is often called *package-private*.
4. **Encapsulation** relies heavily on `private` and getter/setter methods.
5. **Protected** + inheritance allows controlled access across packages.

If you want, I can also give you a **color-coded diagram** showing how these modifiers work across package boundaries so it’s easier to memorize for exams and interviews.
Do you want me to prepare that?
