In Java, **annotations** are a kind of **metadata** that give additional information to the compiler, JVM, or tools about your code — but they don’t directly change the code’s execution logic.

### **Key points:**

1. **Purpose:**

   * To provide **instructions or hints** to the compiler and tools.
   * Help detect mistakes early.
   * Can be used for runtime processing (e.g., in frameworks like Spring).

2. **Types:**

   * **Built-in annotations** (like `@Override`, `@Deprecated`, `@SuppressWarnings`)
   * **Custom annotations** (created with `@interface`)

3. **Your Example with `@Override`:**

   ```java
   @Override
   public void shouldBelongstothisClass()
   ```

   * **`@Override`** tells the compiler:
     *“This method is intended to override a method in the superclass.”*
   * If you mistype the method name or the signature doesn’t match exactly, the compiler will give an error instead of silently creating a new method.

4. **How it works in your code:**

   * `A` has `shouldBelongstothisClass()`
   * `B` overrides it using `@Override`
   * At runtime:

     ```java
     A obj = new B();
     obj.shouldBelongstothisClass(); // Executes B’s version
     ```
   * The `@Override` ensures you don’t accidentally mismatch the method signature.

✅ **In short:**
Annotations are **labels for code** that help the compiler, tools, or frameworks understand *how* your code is supposed to behave, without changing its core logic.
