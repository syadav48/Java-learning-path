Here's a clear breakdown of **JDK, JRE, JVM**, and how Java code is compiled and executed under the hood. This is fundamental knowledge for every Java developer and frequently asked in interviews.

## ☕ Java Execution Flow & Core Components

### 🔁 Life Cycle of a Java Program

Let’s start with **what happens when you write and run a Java program**:

1. **You write Java code** → A `.java` file (source code).
2. **Java Compiler (javac)** compiles it → Produces `.class` file (bytecode).
3. **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** executes `.class` → Converts bytecode to machine code at runtime.

## 🧱 Components: JVM vs JRE vs JDK

### ✅ JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

> JVM is the **engine** that runs your Java code.

* Reads and interprets `.class` files (bytecode).
* Converts bytecode to native machine code **at runtime** using an interpreter or JIT compiler.
* Handles memory management (heap, stack), garbage collection, security, etc.
* **Platform-dependent** (Windows JVM, Linux JVM, etc).

📌 JVM only **executes** the code. It doesn't compile it.

### ✅ JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

> JRE = JVM + Libraries required for execution

* It includes:

  * **JVM**
  * Core Java **class libraries** (like java.lang, java.util)
  * Supporting files/configs

🔸 It's for **running** Java applications, **not developing** them.

---

### ✅ JDK (Java Development Kit)

> JDK = JRE + Development Tools

* It includes:

  * **JRE**
  * **Java Compiler (`javac`)**
  * **Debugger**, JavaDoc, JavaFX, tools like `jarsigner`, etc.

🔸 You need **JDK to write and compile** Java programs.

## ⚙️ Under the Hood: Compilation & Execution

### Example: Hello.java

```java
public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}
```

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Compilation:**

   * Command: `javac Hello.java`
   * Output: `Hello.class` (Bytecode)

2. **Execution:**

   * Command: `java Hello`
   * `java` command launches **JVM**, which loads the `.class` file
   * Bytecode is converted into machine code by JVM → Output printed

---

## 📦 Bytecode & Portability

* **Bytecode** is the intermediate format (like assembly for Java).
* It's **not platform-specific**.
* JVM interprets it or uses **JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler)** to improve performance by compiling hot spots (frequently used code) to native code.

✅ That's why **Java is platform-independent** at the source level but **JVM-dependent** at runtime.

## 🔍 Visual Summary:

```
          [Your Code]
         Hello.java
              |
            javac
              ↓
         Hello.class (Bytecode)
              |
            java
              ↓
           JVM (Reads .class)
              ↓
      Converts to native code
              ↓
         Hello, World!
```

## 🔥 Interview Tip

**Q:** Why is Java called “platform-independent”?
**A:** Because Java code is compiled to bytecode, which can run on any platform using the respective JVM.
