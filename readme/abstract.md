Here’s a **clear and complete note** on **abstract classes and methods**, using your example for reference.

---

## **Abstract Classes & Methods — Notes**

### **1. Abstract Class**

* A class declared with the **`abstract`** keyword.
* It **cannot** be instantiated (i.e., you cannot create objects of it directly).
* It may contain:

  * **Abstract methods** (methods without a body, declared but not implemented).
  * **Concrete methods** (methods with a body).
* Used when you want to provide a **base template** for subclasses but **force them to implement certain methods**.

---

### **2. Abstract Method**

* Declared with **`abstract`** keyword.
* Does **not** have a body (`{}`).
* Must be implemented by **non-abstract subclasses**.

---

### **3. Rules**

| Rule                 | Abstract Class                                        | Abstract Method               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Instantiation**    | Cannot create objects directly                        | N/A                           |
| **Methods allowed**  | Both abstract & concrete methods                      | Only abstract (no body)       |
| **Constructors**     | Yes, can have constructors                            | N/A                           |
| **Final keyword**    | Cannot be `final` (because it’s meant to be extended) | Cannot be `final` or `static` |
| **Access modifiers** | Can have any access modifier                          | Can have any access modifier  |

---

### **4. Example Walkthrough**

```java
abstract class Car {
    public abstract void drive(); // Must be implemented in subclasses
    public abstract void fly();   // Must be implemented in subclasses

    public void playmusic() { // Concrete method
        System.out.println("playing music...");
    }
}

abstract class WagonaR extends Car {
    public void drive() { // Implements one abstract method
        System.out.println("driving");
    }
}

class UpdatedWagonaR extends WagonaR { 
    public void fly() { // Implements the remaining abstract method
        System.out.println("flying");
    }
}

public class AbstractDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car obj = new UpdatedWagonaR(); // Polymorphism
        obj.drive();
        obj.fly();
        obj.playmusic();
    }
}
```

---

### **5. Key Points in the Example**

* `Car` → abstract class, contains abstract (`drive`, `fly`) and concrete (`playmusic`) methods.
* `WagonaR` → abstract class, partially implements abstract methods (`drive`) but still abstract because `fly` is unimplemented.
* `UpdatedWagonaR` → concrete class, implements all remaining abstract methods (`fly`).
* Main method uses **polymorphism**:

  ```java
  Car obj = new UpdatedWagonaR();
  ```

  This allows calling methods defined in `Car` but implemented in child classes.

### **6. When to Use Abstract Classes**

| Situation                                                                                     | Use Abstract Class                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You want **some default implementation** + **some methods must be implemented by subclasses** | ✅                                                                    |
| You want **full abstraction**                                                                 | ❌ (Use an Interface instead)                                         |
| You want to share **state (instance variables)** among subclasses                             | ✅                                                                    |
| You want multiple inheritance                                                                 | ❌ (Java does not support multiple class inheritance, use Interfaces) |

If you want, I can also make you a **comparison table of Abstract Class vs Interface** so you can connect this with **polymorphism** in one go. That would make it very clear.
