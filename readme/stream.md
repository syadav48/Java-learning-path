Great question 🚀 — you’re diving into **Streams in Java**, which is one of the most powerful features introduced in **Java 8**. Let’s break it down step by step with your code as reference.

# 🔹 What is a Stream?

* A **Stream** is a sequence of elements that supports **functional-style operations** (like filtering, mapping, reducing).
* It does **not store data** itself (it works on collections/arrays).
* It processes data in a **pipeline** fashion → operations are chained.
* Streams are **lazy** → intermediate operations (`filter`, `map`) don’t execute until a **terminal operation** (`forEach`, `reduce`, `collect`) is called.

---

# 🔹 Types of Streams

1. **Sequential Stream (`stream()`)**

   * Runs on a **single thread** (default).
   * Processes elements **one after another**.
   * Good for **small/medium datasets**.

   ```java
   nums.stream()
       .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
       .map(n -> n * 2)
       .forEach(System.out::println);
   ```

2. **Parallel Stream (`parallelStream()`)**

   * Splits the data into **multiple chunks** and processes them in **parallel**.
   * Uses **ForkJoinPool** under the hood (utilizing multiple CPU cores).
   * Best for **large datasets** where tasks can be split independently.
   * ⚠️ Should be used carefully because:

     * Not always faster (small data overhead).
     * Order might not be guaranteed unless `forEachOrdered` is used.

   ```java
   nums.parallelStream()
       .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
       .map(n -> n * 2)
       .forEach(System.out::println);
   ```

# 🔹 Stream Pipeline Stages

A **Stream pipeline** = **Source** → **Intermediate operations** → **Terminal operation**

1. **Source**

   * Can be `Collection`, `Arrays.stream()`, `Stream.of()`, `File.lines()`, etc.

   ```java
   List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(4, 5, 8, 3, 5, 9, 12);
   ```

2. **Intermediate Operations** (returns a new stream, **lazy**)

   * `filter(Predicate)` → keep only elements that match condition.
   * `map(Function)` → transform elements.
   * `distinct()` → remove duplicates.
   * `sorted()` → sort elements.
   * `limit(n)` → take first `n`.
   * `skip(n)` → skip first `n`.

   ```java
   nums.stream().filter(n -> n % 2 == 0).map(n -> n * 2)
   ```

3. **Terminal Operations** (triggers execution, consumes stream)

   * `forEach(Consumer)` → process each element.
   * `reduce(identity, accumulator)` → reduce to single value.
   * `collect(Collector)` → collect into `List`, `Set`, `Map`.
   * `count()` → count elements.
   * `min()` / `max()`.
   * `toArray()`.

   ```java
   int sum = nums.stream()
                 .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                 .map(n -> n * 2)
                 .reduce(0, (c, e) -> c + e);
   ```

# 🔹 Your Code Explained

```java
List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(4, 5, 8, 3, 5, 9, 12);
```

### ✅ Without Streams

```java
int sum = 0;
for (int n : nums) {
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        n = n * 2;
        sum = sum + n;
    }
}
System.out.println(sum);
```

* Imperative approach → loop, check, update.

### ✅ With Streams

```java
int result = nums.stream()
                .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0) // keep even
                .map(n -> n * 2)         // double them
                .reduce(0, (c, e) -> c + e); // sum
```

### Output

* If `nums = [4, 5, 8, 3, 5, 9, 12]`
* Even numbers → `[4, 8, 12]`
* Doubled → `[8, 16, 24]`
* Sum → `48`

# 🔹 Key Properties of Streams

1. **One-time use**

   * A stream can be consumed only once.

   ```java
   Stream<Integer> s1 = nums.stream();
   s1.forEach(System.out::println);
   s1.forEach(System.out::println); // ERROR (stream already consumed)
   ```

2. **Doesn’t modify original data**

   * Stream operations produce a **new result**, don’t change source list.

   ```java
   nums.stream().map(n -> n * 2).forEach(System.out::println);
   System.out.println(nums); // Original list unchanged
   ```

3. **Lazy Evaluation**

   * Intermediate ops (`filter`, `map`) won’t run until a terminal op (`reduce`, `forEach`) is used.

# 🔹 When to Use Stream vs ParallelStream

✅ Use **Stream**:

* Small/medium dataset
* Ordering is important
* Single-threaded tasks

✅ Use **ParallelStream**:

* Large dataset
* CPU-intensive operations
* Independent tasks (no dependency between elements)
* When parallelism > overhead

⚠️ Avoid **ParallelStream**:

* When working with small lists
* When operations involve I/O (parallel doesn’t help)
* When order is critical (unless using `forEachOrdered`)

# 🔹 Quick Visual Flow

```
Source (List, Array, Set, File)
         |
     Stream()
         |
   filter() → map() → sorted()  [Intermediate ops]
         |
     reduce() / collect() / forEach() [Terminal op]
```
