# Java: Assignment Operators & Increment Operators

Understanding how assignment and increment/decrement operators work is fundamental in Java.

---

## 1. Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

### Basic Assignment:
```java
int a = 10;
````

### Compound Assignment Operators:

| Operator | Description         | Example  | Equivalent To |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `=`      | Assign              | `a = 10` | —             |
| `+=`     | Add and assign      | `a += 5` | `a = a + 5`   |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign | `a -= 3` | `a = a - 3`   |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign | `a *= 2` | `a = a * 2`   |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign   | `a /= 4` | `a = a / 4`   |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign  | `a %= 3` | `a = a % 3`   |

### Example:

```java
int x = 10;
x += 5; // x = 15
x *= 2; // x = 30
```

---

## 2. Pre-Increment and Post-Increment

Increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators are used to increase or decrease values by 1.

### Pre-Increment (`++a`)

* Increments the value **before** using it.

### Post-Increment (`a++`)

* Uses the current value **first**, then increments.

### Example:

```java
int a = 5;

int b = ++a; // a = 6, b = 6 (increment first, then assign)
int c = a++; // c = 6, a = 7 (assign first, then increment)
```

### Output:

```java
System.out.println("b = " + b); // 6
System.out.println("c = " + c); // 6
System.out.println("a = " + a); // 7
```

---

## 3. Pre-Decrement and Post-Decrement

### Pre-Decrement (`--a`)

* Decrements the value **before** using it.

### Post-Decrement (`a--`)

* Uses the current value **first**, then decrements.

### Example:

```java
int x = 10;
int y = --x; // x = 9, y = 9
int z = x--; // z = 9, x = 8
```

---

## 4. Important Points

* These operators **only work with variables**, not constants or expressions.
* Be careful when using them inside complex expressions (e.g., loops, conditions).

## 5. Practice/Interview Questions

### Q1. What is the output?

```java
int a = 5;
int b = a++ + ++a;
System.out.println("a: " + a + ", b: " + b);
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Initial a = 5  
Step 1: a++ → returns 5, then a = 6  
Step 2: ++a → a becomes 7, returns 7  
b = 5 + 7 = 12  
Final a = 7  
</details>

---

### Q2. What is the result of the following?

```java
int x = 10;
x *= 3 + 2;
System.out.println(x);
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
`x *= 3 + 2` → `x = x * (3 + 2)` = `x = 10 * 5` = 50  
So, output is: `50`
</details>

---

### Q3. Write the output:

```java
int a = 1;
a = a++ + ++a;
System.out.println(a);
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Step-by-step:
- `a++` → returns 1 (a becomes 2)
- `++a` → a becomes 3, returns 3  
So, `a = 1 + 3 = 4`  
Final value: `a = 4`
</details>

---

### Q4. What will be printed?

```java
int a = 10;
int b = a-- - --a;
System.out.println("a: " + a + ", b: " + b);
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- `a--` → returns 10, a = 9
- `--a` → a = 8, returns 8  
So, `b = 10 - 8 = 2`  
Final a = 8, b = 2
</details>

---

### Q5. Which is valid?

```java
int x = 5;
x = x++ * 2;
System.out.println(x);
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- `x++` returns 5, then x becomes 6
- But the expression is `x = 5 * 2 = 10`  
Final x = 10
</details>

---

## 6. Summary

* Use assignment operators to shorten operations.
* Understand the difference between pre/post increment.
* Avoid mixing too many increments in a single expression — it leads to confusion.
