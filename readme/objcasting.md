Alright — let’s go step-by-step so that you fully understand **upcasting** and **downcasting** in Java, using your example and a few more illustrations.

---

## **1. Upcasting in Java**

**Definition:**
Upcasting is when we cast a **child class object** to a **parent class reference**.

* This happens **implicitly** (no explicit cast needed) because **every child IS-A parent**.
* Only the parent’s members (fields/methods) are accessible, even though the object is actually of the child type.
* **Runtime polymorphism** works here — if a method is overridden in the child, the child’s version is executed.

**Example (Your Code’s First Part):**

```java
A obj = new B();  // Upcasting
obj.show1();      // Allowed - defined in A
// obj.show2();   // ❌ Not allowed - show2 is not in A
```

* Here, `obj` is of type `A` (parent) but actually holds an object of `B` (child).
* You can call only methods present in `A`.
* If `B` had overridden `show1()`, the `B` version would run.

**Another Example:**

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
    void wagTail() { System.out.println("Tail wagging"); }
}

Animal a = new Dog(); // Upcasting
a.sound();            // Bark (runtime method binding)
// a.wagTail();       // ❌ Not accessible
```

## **2. Downcasting in Java**

**Definition:**
Downcasting is when we cast a **parent reference** (that is actually pointing to a child object) back into a **child reference**.

* **Explicit casting is required** because **not every parent is a child**.
* Must be **safe** — the object should actually be of the target child type at runtime, otherwise we get a `ClassCastException`.

**Your Code’s Second Part:**

```java
B obj1 = (B) obj;  // Downcasting
obj1.show1();      // in A show
obj1.show2();      // in B show
```

Here:

* `obj` was already pointing to a `B` object (due to upcasting earlier), so the cast is safe.
* Now `obj1` has access to both `show1()` and `show2()`.

**Example of Unsafe Downcasting:**

```java
A a = new A();
B b = (B) a;   // ❌ Runtime error: ClassCastException
```

## **3. Combined Example:**

```java
class Parent {
    void greet() { System.out.println("Hello from Parent"); }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void greet() { System.out.println("Hello from Child"); }
    void play() { System.out.println("Child is playing"); }
}

public class CastingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Child(); // Upcasting
        p.greet(); // Hello from Child (runtime binding)

        // Downcasting to access child-specific methods
        Child c = (Child) p;
        c.play();

        // ❌ Unsafe downcasting
        Parent p2 = new Parent();
        // Child c2 = (Child) p2; // Will throw ClassCastException at runtime
    }
}
```

## **4. Table Summary:**

| Feature             | Upcasting                               | Downcasting                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**      | Child → Parent                          | Parent → Child                                |
| **Casting Needed?** | No (implicit)                           | Yes (explicit)                                |
| **Safety**          | Always safe                             | Safe only if object is actually of child type |
| **Access**          | Only parent’s members                   | Both parent’s and child’s members             |
| **Use Case**        | Runtime polymorphism, method overriding | Accessing child-specific features             |
| **Risk**            | None                                    | `ClassCastException` if unsafe                |

## **5. Interview Perspective:**

* **Upcasting**:

  * Helps achieve **runtime polymorphism**.
  * Allows handling multiple child types using the same parent reference.
* **Downcasting**:

  * Used when you know the object’s actual type and need child-specific methods.
  * Always check using `instanceof` before downcasting:

    ```java
    if (p instanceof Child) {
        Child c = (Child) p;
        c.play();
    }
    ```

If you want, I can prepare **a one-page interview-ready PDF** on *upcasting & downcasting* with diagrams of memory/reference flow so it sticks in memory. Would you like me to make that?
