Alright — let’s break down your code, the comments, and all related **multithreading concepts** into a clean, structured **study note** so you have everything in one place.

# **Java Multithreading – Complete Notes**

---

## **1. What is a Thread?**

* **Thread** → A lightweight sub-process inside a program (process) that executes independently.
* Multiple threads in the same process share memory but execute tasks in parallel.

---

## **2. Two Ways to Create Threads**

### **(a) Extending `Thread` Class**

* Inherit from `Thread` and override the `run()` method.
* Start with `.start()` (not `.run()` directly, as `.run()` will behave like a normal method call).

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running...");
    }
}
public class TestThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start(); // Start thread execution
    }
}
```

---

### **(b) Implementing `Runnable` Interface**  ✅ *(Preferred)*

* Implement `Runnable` interface and override the `run()` method.
* Pass the object to a `Thread` constructor and call `.start()`.

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running via Runnable...");
    }
}
public class TestRunnable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable obj = new MyRunnable();
        Thread t = new Thread(obj);
        t.start();
    }
}
```

**Why Runnable is Preferred?**

* Java **supports single inheritance** (you can’t extend another class if you already extend `Thread`).
* `Runnable` allows your class to extend something else while still supporting multithreading.

---

## **3. Multiple Threads Example (Your Code Logic)**

```java
class A implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Hi");
            try { Thread.sleep(5); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        }
    }
}

class B implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Hello");
            try { Thread.sleep(5); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        }
    }
}

public class MultiThreadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new A());
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new B());
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

**How it works:**

* `t1` and `t2` execute independently.
* `Thread.sleep(5)` → tells the thread to pause for 5 ms to give other threads a chance to run.
* Output order is **non-deterministic** (depends on the thread scheduler).

---

## **4. Thread Scheduler**

* The **Thread Scheduler** is part of the JVM that decides which thread runs and for how long.
* Uses CPU time-slicing & priority to manage execution.
* Scheduling is **OS-dependent** (so exact behavior may differ between systems).

---

## **5. Thread Priority**

* **Each thread has a priority** (integer 1 to 10).
* Constants:

  * `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` (1)
  * `Thread.NORM_PRIORITY` (5 – default)
  * `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY` (10)
* Priority is a *suggestion* to the scheduler, **not a guarantee**.
* Example:

```java
t1.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
t2.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);
```

---

## **6. Thread Sleep**

* `Thread.sleep(ms)` pauses the current thread.
* Useful for:

  * Giving other threads a chance to run.
  * Controlling execution timing.
* Throws `InterruptedException`, so it must be handled in a `try-catch`.

---

## **7. Runnable vs Thread – Key Differences**

| Feature      | `extends Thread`                       | `implements Runnable`                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Inheritance  | Not possible to extend any other class | Can extend another class                          |
| Memory       | Each thread has separate object        | Multiple threads can share same `Runnable` object |
| Flexibility  | Less flexible                          | More flexible                                     |
| Recommended? | No                                     | ✅ Yes                                             |

---

## **8. Real-World Analogy**

* **Extending Thread** → Like building a new machine from scratch.
* **Implementing Runnable** → Like giving existing machines different workers (more reusable).

---

## **9. Key Points from Your Code**

* **Runnable interface** used → better for flexibility.
* `run()` name is **mandatory**; otherwise, thread won’t execute your code.
* **Sleep added** → to make output feel simultaneous (without it, one thread may finish too quickly).
* **Priority set** → but scheduler ultimately decides execution order.
* **Scheduler** → decides execution order based on OS and JVM implementation.

✅ If you want, I can **also create a diagram showing how Thread Scheduler, Runnable, and Thread objects interact** — so your notes have both theory and a visual reference. That’ll help in interviews too.


Here’s a **brief note on Thread States in Java** with **visual representation** and **state transitions** explained in detail.

---

## **Java Thread States and Lifecycle**

A **thread** in Java passes through multiple **states** during its life cycle. These states are defined in the `Thread.State` enum:

---

### **1. NEW (Created State)**

* **When:** A thread object is created but `start()` has **not** been called yet.
* **Example:**

```java
Thread t = new Thread();
```

* **Transition:**

  * Call `start()` → Moves to **RUNNABLE**.

---

### **2. RUNNABLE**

* **When:** The thread is ready to run but **waiting for CPU scheduling**.
* **Example:** After calling `start()`.
* **Transition:**

  * CPU picks thread → Moves to **RUNNING**.

---

### **3. RUNNING**

* **When:** The thread is currently executing its `run()` method.
* **Transition:**

  * Call `sleep()` / `wait()` / join another thread → Moves to **WAITING** or **TIMED\_WAITING**.
  * Finish `run()` → Moves to **TERMINATED**.

---

### **4. WAITING** (Indefinite Wait)

* **When:** Thread is waiting **forever** for another thread to signal.
* **Example:**

```java
synchronized(obj) {
    obj.wait(); // waits until notify() or notifyAll()
}
```

* **Transition:**

  * Another thread calls `notify()` / `notifyAll()` → Moves back to **RUNNABLE**.

---

### **5. TIMED\_WAITING** (Waiting for a Specific Time)

* **When:** Thread waits for **a specific time** and then becomes runnable again.
* **Example:**

```java
Thread.sleep(2000); // sleep for 2 seconds
```

* **Transition:**

  * Timeout expires → Moves back to **RUNNABLE**.

---

### **6. TERMINATED (Dead)**

* **When:** Thread finishes execution of `run()` method.
* **Example:** Cannot restart a terminated thread.

---

## **Visual Representation of Thread Lifecycle**

```
         NEW
          |
     start()
          ↓
     +----------+
     | RUNNABLE |
     +----------+
          ↓ (CPU picks)
      RUNNING
        /   \
 sleep()/wait()     run() finishes
     ↓               ↓
 WAITING / TIMED_WAITING   TERMINATED
     ↑
 notify()/timeout
```

---

## **Methods That Cause State Changes**

| Method                     | From State | To State                 |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| `start()`                  | NEW        | RUNNABLE                 |
| `sleep(ms)`                | RUNNING    | TIMED\_WAITING           |
| `wait()`                   | RUNNING    | WAITING                  |
| `notify()` / `notifyAll()` | WAITING    | RUNNABLE                 |
| `join()`                   | RUNNING    | WAITING / TIMED\_WAITING |
| Finish `run()`             | RUNNING    | TERMINATED               |

---

## **Example of Thread States**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println("Thread is running");
            Thread.sleep(2000); // TIMED_WAITING
            synchronized(this) {
                wait(); // WAITING
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

public class ThreadStatesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        System.out.println(t.getState()); // NEW
        t.start();
        System.out.println(t.getState()); // RUNNABLE
        Thread.sleep(100);
        System.out.println(t.getState()); // TIMED_WAITING or WAITING
    }
}
```

## **Why Understanding Thread States is Important in Real-World Apps**

* **UI Applications:** Keep the UI responsive by moving heavy work to background threads.
* **Web Servers:** Handle multiple client requests simultaneously.
* **Gaming:** Multiple threads for rendering, sound, and physics simultaneously.
* **Data Processing:** Parallel threads for faster computation.

If you want, I can create a **colorful diagram showing all thread states with arrows and method triggers** so it’s visually memorable. That would make learning this even easier.
