Here’s a **clear and concise summary** of your notes about how Java runs under the hood — from hardware to JVM:

---

### 🧠 Java Execution Flow (from hardware to code execution):

1. **🖥️ Hardware → 💻 Operating System (OS):**

   * Your physical machine runs an operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.).

2. **📦 JDK (Java Development Kit):**

   * The full Java package developers use.
   * Contains:

     * **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment) → for running Java apps.
     * **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine) → for executing bytecode.
     * **javac** (Java Compiler) → to compile `.java` files to `.class` files (bytecode).
     * Other dev tools like `jshell`, `javadoc`, `javap`, etc.

3. **🧰 JRE (Java Runtime Environment):**

   * Provides the **environment to run** Java applications.
   * Includes:

     * **JVM**: Executes bytecode.
     * **Java class libraries**: Prebuilt classes (like `System`, `String`, etc.).
   * 🔁 Think of JRE as: **JVM + Core Libraries**

4. **⚙️ JVM (Java Virtual Machine):**

   * The engine that **executes Java bytecode**.
   * Platform-dependent: there’s a different JVM for Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.
   * Makes Java **platform-independent at the code level**: WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere).

### 🔄 Code Compilation & Execution:

1. **You write Java code**:

   ```java
   class Hello {
       public static void main(String[] var0) {
           System.out.println("Hello World");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Compiler (`javac`) converts it to bytecode**:

   * Output file: `Hello.class`
   * This `.class` file is **platform-independent bytecode**.

3. **JVM runs the bytecode**:

   * JVM **loads `Hello.class`** and looks specifically for a method with this signature:

     ```java
     public static void main(String[] args)
     ```
   * If it's not present, the JVM will not execute the file.

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:

* 🔁 **Java is platform-independent**, but the **JVM is platform-dependent**.
* ✅ **JVM only understands bytecode**, not raw `.java` files.
* 📂 In large projects, there can be **many `.java` files**, but **execution starts from the file containing the correct `main()` method**.

### 🧪 Summary Formula:

```text
JDK ⊃ JRE ⊃ JVM
Java Code (.java) --[compiled via javac]--> Bytecode (.class) --[executed by JVM]--> Output
```
